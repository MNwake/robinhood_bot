# Trading Bot Simulator

A Python-based **Trading Bot Simulator** designed to test and optimize various trading strategies using real-time market data. This project is a part of my software development portfolio and is currently **in development**. The primary goal of this application is to simulate trading strategies and analyze their performance over time, making it an excellent tool for backtesting and learning about algorithmic trading.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
To test this application, you need the following:
- **Python 3.8 or later**
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `ROBINHOOD_API_KEY`: Your Robinhood API key
  - `ROBINHOOD_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your private key for Robinhood authentication

## üìà Usage

### **How It Works**
1. The bot fetches real-time price data for BTC and ETH.
2. Trades are simulated based on the configured trading strategy (e.g., moving average crossover).
3. Balances and trade history are updated in real-time.
4. Insights into trade performance are logged for analysis.

### **Current Limitations**
- The bot **does not execute real trades** (yet).
- Still under development‚Äîuse with caution.
